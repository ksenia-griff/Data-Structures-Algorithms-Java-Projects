1. Hours to complete the project: 30 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Autocomplete Term): easy one, I followed the
   project checklist. 

   Problem 2 (Binary Search Deluxe): I have an issue here. My output is not the same and does not pass the test. I dont know what the issue is. I asked on Piazaa but didnot get a response, so i don't know...

   Problem 3 (Autocomplete): I completed this one, but because my BinarySearchDeluxe.java has an issue, it cannot produce the correct output.

   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   It was a challenge for me....It is the first assignment that i did not complete...I wish we had more hours of preparation for such assignments...I reached out for tutoting once but i did not have my questions answered, so i hope more hours of supplementary on a class level, group level, mandatory, would be introduced in the future...for questions-having students like myself...
